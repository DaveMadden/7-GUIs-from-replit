## Dave Madden's "7 GUIs" Takehome Assignment
Assignment:
Create the first 6 of the 7 GUIs using React+Typescript

## The GUIs
### The Counter
### The Temperature Converter
This works, but if I have the time I'll come back and refactor to using one hook and one changeHandler.

### The Flight Booker
### The Timer!
I got this working, but I would like to revisit this with a custom hook (more flexible) like in this blog post

### CRUD
UPDATE and DELETE only enabled if a NAME in the NAMELIST is selected.

When a name is selected, it populates the Inputs, where it can be UPDATED or DELETED. If text is modified, but CREATE is pressed, will create a new NAME.

At any point, pressing CREATE (as long as the inputs are not empty) takes the content of the Inputs, CREATES a new NAME in the NAMELIST, and deselects (which empties the Inputs.)

The FILTER INPUT filters the array for NAMES that match the text in the FILTER INPUT

### Circle Drawer
